# Neuromorphic SNN Development Tools

A comprehensive investigation of software development tools and frameworks for implementing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic processors.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the research, experiments, and analysis conducted for the MSc dissertation titled **"Investigating Software Development Tools for Neuromorphic Processors to Implement Spiking Neural Networks"** as part of the MSc Machine Learning & Deep Learning program at the University of Strathclyde.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

This project investigates and evaluates various software development tools and frameworks designed for neuromorphic computing, with a focus on:

- Comparative analysis of neuromorphic development frameworks
- Implementation of Spiking Neural Networks using different tools
- Performance evaluation and benchmarking
- Assessment of developer experience and usability
- Documentation of best practices and recommendations
